Demand Forecasting=>
For demand forecasting we took max values for 2019 and 2020 demands predicted using the following two models.

Linear Regression:
The first model is a simple linear regressor where seperate linear regression models were trained for 4096 demand points.

N-BEATS: 
In order to capture spatial information we took the task of prediction from univariate time series to multivariate time series.
We divided the supply grid into smaller grids of 4*4 and then we trained seperate NBEATS model using DART python module.

Optimiztion:
For optimization task we used linear programming, since all of our constraints were linear. This was achieved with the help of PULP module.
